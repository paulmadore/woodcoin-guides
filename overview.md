# Woodcoin Overview

## The Logarithmic Boogie 
Funkenstein the Dwarf established Woodcoin with a singular purpose in mind for cryptocurrency: sustainability. 

Thus, the first, and definitely most important innovation of the Woodcoin project is what’s called a “logarithmic supply schedule.” 

What this means, in essence, is that instead of a system-shocking “halvening” event every four years which allegedly boosts the value of all coins in the system, Woodcoin decreases inflation with every new block, or every two minutes.

Based on Litecoin, which is built on Bitcoin, Woodcoin shares most other fundamental characteristics with all three – and more. 

It would be false to say that Funkestein saw an overall issue with the design of Bitcoin. Rather, he wanted to experiment with an idea that might improve public coins, and in the process a community established itself. 

Funkestein primarily reports to the world through Woodcoin.info and stewards community resources in an effort to boost the cause of Woodcoin. 

There are technical differences which you can read about in the whitepaper, including the way that blocks are signed. These are not important, however, for understanding the primary intention of the Woodcoin project. 

## Historically Under Attack 

Like all cryptocurrencies, Woodcoin has had a shifting value. When the value was higher, years back, Woodcoin experienced a number of mining attacks. A single miner would arrive on the  mining network, mine several blocks without transactions, and then leave the network, having raised the difficulty such that no one else on the network could find a block.

This situation would frequently paralyze the woodcoin network for hours on end, until various improvements and measures were introduced by Core contributors. 

## Building A Legitimate Blockchain

Bitcoin retains a fundamental value proposition that no ICO or IEO will ever have: it was born natively, honestly, and cannot be controlled by a single entity. While it’s true that the network could use some tweaks or a great deal more hash power, overall the Woodcoin project retains the fundamental and important features of Bitcoin that even Bitcoin Core seems to have lost. 

More important than that, the software works as intended, and people have access to their money. There is a mobile wallet, with more software releases to come. 

The validity of the Woodcoin blockchain makes it ripe for more real-world use cases.

## The Tokenized Future

Which brings us to our present focus: building a number of projects which rely on the Woodcoin project and cryptography to securely process data. 
Building such projects will create a use case for Woodcoin, and hopefully expand interest and adoption. If not, the technology will be useful for other cryptocurrency projects moving forward. Anyway you look at it, Woodcoin has contributed, and continues to do so. 
The token is tradeable on multiple exchanges at present, and a number of projects continue to be built on top of Woodcoin Core. 

## Keeping Up With Woodcoin

The best way to keep with Woodcoin is to read Woodcoin.info, a regular blog by core contributors of the Woodcoin project.
